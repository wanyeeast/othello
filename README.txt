We worked together creating the principal variation search and managed to get it working. Jeffrey did most of the framework for the basic AI. Wayne worked on debugging and trying to clean up the code. 

We continued to try to implement minimax with the heuristics. We also worked on a principal variation search for the past week. We are now trying to update the heuristics up until the deadline.
